# synapse-delurlcache
Delete images and thumbnails created by URL previews in Synapse

**Not required anymore**

Synapse versions 0.24.0 and higher delete their URL caches themselves.  There is no need anymore to run this script!

**Purpose**

In versions up to 0.23.1, when Synapse created URL previews, the images that are created in media_store/url_cache and media_store/url_cache_thumbnails were never deleted.  Relatively quickly, they could use large amounts of disk space.

Synapse versions prior to 0.22.0 stored the files among local content in media_store/local_content and media_store/local_thumbnails.  Files stored there by earlier Synapse versions remain there.

This script finds all such images that are older than one day (default) and deletes them from the database and the file system.

**Caveats**

* Use at your own risk! The script alters your Synapse database!  Always make a backup copy of the database and maybe the media store directories first.  Don't blame me if everything explodes around you, you have been warned.
* The script assumes you are using PostgreSQL as database backend.  I don't have a homeserver with an Sqlite database I could test with.  PRs welcome.
* Tested only with Synapse 0.23.1, 0.22.0, and 0.22.1.  The previous version was tested with Synapse 0.21.1 and is still available in the Synapse0.21.1 branch.  The current script should work with 0.21.1, too, but I didn't test that.

**Instructions**

Requires the Perl DBI module with Postgres support to be present.  In Debian, that would be libdbi-perl.

Change the variables at the beginning of the script to fit your homeserver.

Start the script with a test:

```./delurlcache.pl 1```

This will delete only one URL cache entry and tell you what it did.

If everything looks ok, you can start it with larger numbers:

```./delurlcache.pl 100 > delurlcache.log```

will delete 100 cache entries.  Note the redirection to a file:  delurlcache.pl intentionally logs every single step it does, so in case something goes wrong, you know where to look if you have to fix things.

If you think it will manage to do everything as it should, you can tell it to delete all images older than the threshold you defined when editing the variables:

```./delurlcache.pl 0 > delurlcache.log```

Good luck!
